# zkTLS Integration with Reclaim Protocol - Enhanced Demo ðŸš€

This is an enhanced [Expo](https://expo.dev) project that demonstrates zkTLS integration using Reclaim Protocol on XION blockchain. It supports both the original tutorial flow and advanced custom implementations.

## âœ¨ Enhanced Features

### ðŸ”¥ Default Flow (Tutorial Compatible)
- Pre-configured RUM contract with hardcoded "followers_count" claim key
- Perfect for following the [XION zkTLS tutorial](https://docs.burnt.com/xion/developers/mobile-app-development/zktls-integration-using-reclaim-in-a-xion-mobile-app)
- Works immediately without additional setup

### âš¡ Custom Flow (Advanced)
- Deploy your own RUM contracts with custom claim keys
- Full control over contract configuration
- Support for any Reclaim proof data field
- Perfect for unique use cases and production implementations

## ðŸ“‹ Prerequisites

- Node.js (LTS version)
- Android Studio (for Android emulator) or Xcode (for iOS simulator)
- A Reclaim Protocol account with configured application and provider

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Set up environment variables

   Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with the following variables:

   ```bash
   # Required for both flows
   EXPO_PUBLIC_TREASURY_CONTRACT_ADDRESS="your-treasury-contract-address"
   EXPO_PUBLIC_RPC_ENDPOINT="https://rpc.xion-testnet-2.burnt.com:443"
   EXPO_PUBLIC_REST_ENDPOINT="https://api.xion-testnet-2.burnt.com"

   # Reclaim Protocol Configuration  
   EXPO_PUBLIC_RECLAIM_APP_ID="your-reclaim-app-id"
   EXPO_PUBLIC_RECLAIM_APP_SECRET="your-reclaim-secret"
   EXPO_PUBLIC_RECLAIM_PROVIDER_ID="your-reclaim-provider-id"

   # For Default Flow
   EXPO_PUBLIC_RUM_CONTRACT_ADDRESS="your-default-rum-contract-address"

   # For Custom Flow Contract Deployment
   EXPO_PUBLIC_CODE_ID="1289"
   EXPO_PUBLIC_VERIFICATION_CONTRACT_ADDRESS="xion1qf8jtznwf0tykpg7e65gwafwp47rwxl4x2g2kldvv357s6frcjlsh2m24e"
   ```

3. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
